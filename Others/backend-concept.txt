#  How to setup a backend
1. first create a folder
2. create two folders backend and frontend (backend for all the backend files and frontend for all the frontend files)
3. in the terminal change the directory to the folder containing the folders backend and frontend 
4. now in the terminal write npm init
5. answer all the set of questions
6. if you are ok with the thing just click enter 
7. test command let it be as it is
8. let the keywords be as it is
9. now a package.json file will be created
10. it will contain all the answers we gave in terminal 
11. Now we will first connect to a mongoDB Atlas
12. for it go to MongoDB Atlas website
13. login or sign up
14. create and name the project
15. create a cluster 
16. select the nearest region
17. u will get a window with a username and password 
18. copy it and create a database username
19. choose the connection method compass
18. copy the uri
19. create a file in the root folder named .env (it stores all you enviornment variables these are secrets so these don't get pushed to github)
20. In it write MONGODB_URI = the uri you copied
21. go to database access and edit the password
22. copy the password and replace it in the .env file 
23. now create a src folder in it create another folder config
24. in the config folder create the constants.js
25. in the .env file specify "type":"module";
26. from the constants.js export eh database name in a variable
27. create a app.js in src folder not config folder
28. import the express app in app.js anything that is not installed can be installed using npm i <dependency name>
29. this will now be added to to package.json in dependencies
28. you will also see that node_modules and package-lock.json are created
29. to hide node_modules and .env u need to create .gitignore
30. go to browser search for .gitigonre generator and generate for node and copy and paste in the .gitigonre file created by you in the root folder
31. this will prevent to push the important files to github
32. in the app.js define constant app with express(); and export the constant as default
33. Now create database.js in the config folder this will connect to the mongodb database
34. import mongoose in it from mongoose it talks to mongodb
35. for it also install mongoose by npm
36. make a constant connectDB with an async function
37. in the function define try and catch blocks
38. in the try define a constant  connectionInstance with await mongooose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}`)
39. now console.log(`mongoose connected ${connectionInstance.connection.host}`) with it you will come to know if it is connected to the mongo database
40. in the catch write console.log(`MonogDB connection failed ${error}`); and then process.exit(1); this will exit the whole process and tell its all done
41. to use it export default connectDB
42. now in the src folder create index.js which will start the Server
43. in it import dotenv from dotenv you need to install from npm it helps us to extract all the enviornment variables
44. write dotenv.config({
    path: './.env' this will let dotenv know that from which file do you need the enviornment variables
});
45. make another constant as start server with async function and try and catch in it
46. in try await for connectDB(); after importing it
47. then write app.on('error',(error)=>{
    console.log("ERROR",error);
    throw error;
}); starts the app
48. then you write app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8000 , ()=>{
    console.log("server is running on port" + process.env.PORT);
}) defines a port where it works if not available go to 8000 port
49. in the .env file write PORT = 4000 or any other
50. in catch write console.log("faild"+error);
51. write StartServer();
52. in the package.json file change the scripts to "start":"node src/index.js", "dev":"nodemon src/index.js"
53. install nodemon
54. run with npm run dev
