let productColors = ['blue','green'];

// console.log(productColors[0]); this is how we access the elements in an array and it starts with 0 and then 1,2,3 and so on
// productColors[0] = 42; this is how we change any value of a key
// console.log(productColors); this shows us that an array is objects and it is a data structure which allows us to store a list of data
// console.log(productColors.length); this is how u come to know about the length of the array
